      <h3>Behemoth Biography</h3>
      <p>
        A leading light in the Polish metal scene, Behemoth emerged in the early
        1990s with a caustic cocktail of black and death metal that was made all
        the more punitive by a heavy dose of religious provocation. Both
        sonically and socially pugilistic -- they were criminally charged by the
        Polish government for tearing up a bible and emblazoning the country's
        coat of arms on a T-shirt -- the band released their first full-length
        recording, 1995's Sventevith, to favorable reviews. Subsequent albums
        like The Apostasy (2007), I Loved You at Your Darkest (2018), and Opvs
        Contra Natvram (2022) displayed a wide musical vision that incorporated
        folk music, synthesizers, choirs, and orchestras, while still managing
        to retain their brutal, extreme metal sound. The group endured numerous
        lineup shifts during their career, with founding singer/guitarist Nergal
        being the only constant member.

        Behemoth were formed in 1991 (originally as a trio), and began issuing
        several demos shortly thereafter, the most circulated one being 1993's
        From the Pagan Vastlands. The same year, the band issued their debut
        release And the Forests Dream Eternally on the Italian independent label
        Entropy. Two years later, the group released its first full-length
        recording, Sventevith, which drew significant acclaim in the metal
        underground. For 1996's Grom, Behemoth expanded their sonic attack by
        experimenting with acoustic elements and electronics and adding female
        vocalists. Released in 1997, the three-track stopgap EP Bewitching the
        Pomerania proved to be the first recording to feature drummer Inferno
        (Zbigniew Robert Promiński), who soon became a driving force (and
        permanent fixture) in the band.

        Their fifth release overall, Pandemonic Incantations, was issued a year
        later in 1998, as Behemoth continued to average at least one lineup
        change per release. Their last release as a trio (and first for new
        label Avantgarde), 1999's Satanica, continued to expand the group's
        following among the black metal masses, as Behemoth secured supporting
        slots on two separate tours with leading bands of the genre: Deicide and
        Satyricon. Behemoth's first release of the 21st century, 2000's
        Thelema.6, saw the group's lineup expand to four members for the first
        time, as newcomers Novy (bass) and Havoc (guitar) signed on with
        stalwarts Nergal and Inferno. The album was the first of the group's
        career to receive worldwide distribution -- it was issued in the U.S. a
        year after its initial release -- and also featured Nergal collaborating
        lyrically with outsider Krzysztof Azarewicz.

        Behemoth embarked on their most substantial tour yet, playing shows
        alongside the likes of Morbid Angel and Nile, and even launched a few
        headlining tours on their own. In 2002, a home video/DVD was issued
        (recorded in their homeland of Poland), The Art of Rebellion: Live. Zos
        Kia Cultus followed a year later and was supported by a world tour
        including, for the first time, the United States.

        Kia Cultus followed a year later and was supported by a world tour
        including, for the first time, the United States. Demigod Demigod landed
        at the beginning of 2004, a signal album that marked their first with
        bassist Orion (Tomasz Wróblewski). Behemoth's eighth full-length, The
        Apostasy, arrived in 2007, and added piano and a horn section to their
        already considerable arsenal. Ezkaton was an EP released in 2008, and
        featured a handful of studio cuts along with some live tracks. It was
        followed in 2009 by the full-length Evangelion, which earned positive
        reviews and chart success across Europe and America. The band's momentum
        paused briefly in 2010, when Nergal received a diagnosis of leukemia in
        the spring and spent almost a year recovering. A stopgap 2011
        compilation, Abyssus Abyssum Invocat, combined two EPs from the band,
        2004's Conjuration and 2006's Slaves Shall Serve.
      </p>

        Behemoth returned to action in 2014 with The Satanist, which received
        nearly universal positive reviews and became their first album to debut
        in the Top 40 of the American album charts. In 2018, the band released
        the concert album/film Messe Noire, which featured songs culled from a
        pair of 2016 shows in Warsaw, Poland and the Brutal Assault 2016 open
        air festival in Czechoslovakia. The group's dynamic 11th full-length, I
        Loved You at Your Darkest, employed a compelling amalgam of face-melting
        extreme metal and more accessible, traditional hard rock with orchestral
        flourishes. May 2020 saw the release of the EP A Forest, which included
        a cover of the Cure song of the same name. Recording during the COVID-19
        pandemic, Behemoth took advantage of some time away from touring and
        emerged in 2022 with the heavy, but detailed Opvs Contra Natvram.
